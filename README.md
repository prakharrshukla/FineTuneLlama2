# Fine-Tune GPT Models

Comprehensive fine-tuning guide for GPT-2, Llama 2, and other language models. Optimized for RTX 4070.

## What this includes

- Complete fine-tuning tutorial in one Jupyter notebook
- Basic to advanced fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, hyperparameter optimization)
- Comprehensive evaluation and bias testing
- Production deployment examples (FastAPI, Gradio)
- Research methodologies and best practices
- Works efficiently on RTX 4070 (8GB VRAM)

## Quick setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakharrshukla/FineTuneLlama2.git
cd FineTuneLlama2
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate peft
```

## Troubleshooting

**Out of memory?** Reduce batch size or use gradient checkpointing
**Slow training?** Enable mixed precision with fp16=True
**Package errors?** Create a fresh virtual environment
**Model quality issues?** Increase training data or adjust learning rate
